# Checks whether the OS versions .woodpecker/release.yaml targets have gone
# stale, so that doesn't have to be discovered by an actual release build
# failing months from now. Meant to run periodically (see
# .woodpecker/check-target-freshness.yaml's cron trigger), not on every
# commit - these versions change on the order of months/years, not days.
#
# Checks three independent things, each against the pin currently hardcoded
# in .woodpecker/release.yaml:
#   1. Has Debian trixie been demoted from "stable" to "oldstable"?
#   2. Is Ubuntu 26.04 still the latest LTS release?
#   3. Is FreeBSD 15.1-RELEASE still the latest FreeBSD release?
#
# Exits non-zero (so the CI job shows red) if any pin is stale - that's the
# whole point, to be loud rather than silently drift. Exits non-zero on a
# network/parse failure too (fail loud rather than silently report "fresh"
# when a check couldn't actually run).
#
# Note: this only checks the base OS/version pins. Each program's own FreeBSD
# dependency closure (fetched live by scripts/fetch-freebsd-deps.py against
# whatever pkg.freebsd.org currently serves for the pinned FreeBSD release) is
# not pinned anywhere and so cannot go stale in this sense - see NOTES.md.

# Keep these in sync with .woodpecker/release.yaml by hand - deliberately
# not derived automatically from that file, so a change to one doesn't
# silently change what this script considers "current" without a human
# noticing the two have diverged.
