# Extracts just one release's section from RELEASE_NOTES.md, for use as a
# GitHub Release body (`gh release create --notes-file`) - RELEASE_NOTES.md
# itself holds the full history of every release (see AGENTS.md), so it
# can't be used verbatim as a single release's notes.
#
# Each entry starts with a line like "## v2026.09.22 — <summary>" and has a
# "### User-facing changes" subsection followed by a "### Details" subsection
# (see AGENTS.md's release convention: the merge/release description is
# user-facing changes only, no low-level implementation detail -
# RELEASE_NOTES.md keeps the Details narrative for posterity, but it isn't
# what should ship in a GitHub Release body). This prints only from the
# "## vX.Y.Z" heading up to (not including) "### Details" - or up to the next
# "## v" heading as a fallback if an entry has no Details subsection at all.
#
# Usage: extract-release-notes.sh <tag> <release-notes-file>
# Prints the section to stdout; exits 1 if the tag has no matching heading.
